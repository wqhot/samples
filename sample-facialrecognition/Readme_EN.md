# Facial Recognition<a name="EN-US_TOPIC_0232642722"></a>

Developers can deploy the application on the Atlas 200 DK to implement face registrations, predict the face information in a video by using cameras, and compare the predicted face with the registered face to output the most possible user.

The applications in the current version branch adapt to  [DDK&RunTime](https://ascend.huawei.com/resources) **1.32.0.0 and later**.

## Prerequisites<a name="en-us_topic_0228461922_section137245294533"></a>

Before deploying this sample, ensure that:

-   Mind Studio  has been installed.
-   The Atlas 200 DK developer board has been connected to  Mind Studio, the cross compiler has been installed, the SD card has been prepared, and basic information has been configured.

## Building a Project<a name="en-us_topic_0228461922_section147911829155918"></a>

1.  Open the project.

    Go to the directory that stores the decompressed installation package as the Mind Studio installation user in CLI mode, for example,  **$HOME/MindStudio-ubuntu/bin**. Run the following command to start Mind Studio:

    **./MindStudio.sh**

    After the startup is successful, open the  **sample-facialrecognition**  project, as shown in  [Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig28591855104218).

    **Figure  1**  Opening the sample-facialrecognition project<a name="en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig28591855104218"></a>  
    ![](figures/opening-the-sample-facialrecognition-project.png "opening-the-sample-facialrecognition-project")

2.  Configure project information in the  **src/param\_configure.conf**  file.

    For details, see  [Figure 2](#en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig1338571124515).

    **Figure  2**  Configuration file path<a name="en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig1338571124515"></a>  
    

    ![](figures/facial_open_src.png)

    The default configurations of the configuration file are as follows:

    ```
    remote_host=192.168.1.2
    data_source=Channel-1
    presenter_view_app_name=video
    ```

    -   **remote\_host**: IP address of the Atlas 200 DK developer board
    -   **data\_source**: camera channel. The value can be  **Channel-1**  or  **Channel-2**. For details, see  **Viewing the Channel to Which a Camera Belongs**  in  [Atlas 200 DK User Guide](https://ascend.huawei.com/doc/Atlas200DK/).
    -   **presenter\_view\_app\_name**: indicates the value of  **View Name**  on the  **Presenter Server**  page, which must be unique. The value consists of 3 to 20 characters and supports only uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and underscores \(\_\).

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   All the three parameters must be set. Otherwise, the build fails.  
    >-   Do not use double quotation marks \(""\) during parameter settings.  
    >-   Modify the default configurations as required.  

3.  Run the  **deploy.sh**  script to adjust configuration parameters and download and compile the third-party library. Open the  **Terminal**  window of Mind Studio. By default, the home directory of the code is used. Run the  **deploy.sh**  script in the background to deploy the environment, as shown in  [Figure 3](#en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig16909182592016).

    **Figure  3**  Running the deploy.sh script<a name="en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig16909182592016"></a>  
    ![](figures/running-the-deploy-sh-script.png "running-the-deploy-sh-script")

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   During the first deployment, if no third-party library is used, the system automatically downloads and builds the third-party library, which may take a long time. The third-party library can be directly used for the subsequent compilation.  
    >-   During deployment, select the IP address of the host that communicates with the developer board. Generally, the IP address is the IP address configured for the virtual NIC. If the IP address is in the same network segment as the IP address of the developer board, it is automatically selected for deployment. If they are not in the same network segment, you need to manually type the IP address of the host that communicates with the developer board to complete the deployment.  

4.  Start the build. Open Mind Studio and choose  **Build \> Build \> Build-Configuration**  from the main menu. The  **build**  and  **run**  folders are generated in the directory, as shown in  [Figure 4](#en-us_topic_0228461922_en-us_topic_0203223340_fig1629455494718).
