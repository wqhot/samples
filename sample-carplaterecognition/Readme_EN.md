## Build<a name="en-us_topic_0228461932_section1759513564117"></a>

1.  Open the project.

    Go to the directory that stores the decompressed installation package as the Mind Studio installation user in CLI mode, for example,  **$HOME/MindStudio-ubuntu/bin**. Run the following command to start Mind Studio:

    **./MindStudio.sh**

    Open the  **sample-carplaterecognition**  project, as shown in  [Figure 1](#en-us_topic_0228461932_en-us_topic_0218873008_fig721144422212).

    **Figure  1**  Opening the sample-carplaterecognition project<a name="en-us_topic_0228461932_en-us_topic_0218873008_fig721144422212"></a>  
    

    ![](figures/en-us_image_0218876987.png)

2.  Configure project information in the  **src/param\_configure.conf**  file.

    **Figure  2**  Configuration file path<a name="en-us_topic_0228461932_en-us_topic_0218873008_fig1557065718252"></a>  
    

    ![](figures/en-us_image_0218877806.png)

    The default configurations of the configuration file are as follows:

    ```
    remote_host=192.168.1.2
    data_source=Channel-1
    presenter_view_app_name=video
    ```

    -   **remote\_host**: IP address of the Atlas 200 DK developer board
    -   **data\_source**: camera channel. The value can be  **Channel-1**  or  **Channel-2**. For details, see "Viewing the Channel to Which a Camera Belongs" in  [Atlas 200 DK User Guide](https://ascend.huawei.com/documentation).
    -   **presenter\_view\_app\_name**: value of  **View Name**  on the  **Presenter Server**  page, which must be unique. The value consists of at least one character and supports only uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and underscores \(\_\).

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   All the three parameters must be set. Otherwise, the build fails.  
    >-   Do not use double quotation marks \(""\) during parameter settings.  
    >-   Modify the default configurations as required.  

3.  Run the  **deploy.sh**  script to adjust configuration parameters and download and compile the third-party library. Open the  **Terminal**  window of Mind Studio. By default, the home directory of the code is used. Run the  **deploy.sh**  script in the background to deploy the environment, as shown in  [Figure 3](#en-us_topic_0228461932_en-us_topic_0218873008_fig19393122943511).

    ![](figures/running-the-deploy-sh-script.png "running-the-deploy-sh-script")

    >![](public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >-   During the first deployment, if no third-party library is used, the system automatically downloads and builds the third-party library, which may take a long time. The third-party library can be directly used for the subsequent build.  
    >-   During deployment, select the IP address of the host that communicates with the developer board. Generally, the IP address is that configured for the virtual NIC. If the IP address is in the same network segment as the IP address of the developer board, it is automatically selected for deployment. If they are not in the same network segment, you need to manually type the IP address of the host that communicates with the developer board to complete the deployment.  

4.  Start building. Open Mind Studio and choose  **Build \> Build \> Build-Configuration**  from the main menu. The  **build**  and  **run**  folders are generated in the directory, as shown in  [Figure 4](#en-us_topic_0228461932_en-us_topic_0218873008_fig13819202814301).
